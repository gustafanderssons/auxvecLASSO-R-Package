\title{Print Summary of Auxiliary Vector Assessment}
\usage{
\method{print}{assess_aux_vector}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{assess_aux_vector} containing diagnostic results.
Expected to have components:
\describe{
\item{weight_variation}{Named numeric vector or list of weight variation metrics.}
\item{register_diagnostics}{List with \code{total} and \code{by_domain} components,
each containing diagnostic summaries (mean, SE, bias, MSE) for variables.}
\item{survey_diagnostics}{List with \code{total} and \code{by_domain} components,
each containing diagnostic summaries (mean, SE, bias, MSE) for variables.}
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.
}
\description{
S3 print method for objects of class \code{assess_aux_vector}.
Displays a formatted and colorized summary of diagnostics related to
auxiliary variable assessments including weight variation metrics,
register diagnostics (overall and by domain), and survey diagnostics
(overall and by domain).
}
\details{
Requires the \pkg{crayon} package for colored output.

The print method outputs sections with colored headers for easier readability:
\itemize{
\item Weight Variation Metrics
\item Register Diagnostics summarized for all units and by domain
\item Survey Diagnostics summarized for all units and by domain
}
Each diagnostic includes mean, standard error, bias, and mean squared error.
If the \pkg{crayon} package is not installed, the function will stop with an error.

# Assuming 'aux_vector_assessment' is an assess_aux_vector object:
print(aux_vector_assessment)
