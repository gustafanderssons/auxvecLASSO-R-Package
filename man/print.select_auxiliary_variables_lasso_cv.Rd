\title{Print Summary of LASSO Auxiliary Variable Selection Object}
\usage{
\method{print}{select_auxiliary_variables_lasso_cv}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{select_auxiliary_variables_lasso_cv} containing
results from LASSO auxiliary variable selection with cross-validation.
Expected to have components:
\describe{
\item{selected_variables}{Character vector of variables selected across outcomes.}
\item{by_outcome}{Named list, with each element a character vector of selected variables for that outcome.}
\item{selected_lambdas}{Named numeric vector or list of selected lambda values by outcome.}
\item{penalty_factors}{Numeric vector of penalty factors (0 = must-keep, 1 = regular penalty).}
\item{models}{List of fitted models stored for each outcome.}
\item{goodness_of_fit}{Named list of goodness-of-fit results by outcome, each containing
\code{cross_validated} (with \code{cv_error}, \code{cv_error_sd}) and \code{full_data}
(with \code{deviance_explained}, \code{auc}, \code{accuracy}, \code{brier_score}, \code{raw_coefs}).}
\item{interaction_metadata}{List with \code{interaction_terms}, \code{main_effects_in_interactions}, and \code{full_formula}.}
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently ignored).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the input object \code{x}.
}
\description{
S3 print method for objects of class \code{select_auxiliary_variables_lasso_cv}.
Displays a formatted and colorized summary of the selected auxiliary variables,
their grouping by outcome, selected penalty parameters (lambdas),
penalty factors, stored models, goodness-of-fit metrics, coefficient estimates,
and interaction metadata.
}
\details{
Requires the \pkg{crayon} package for colored output.

The print method outputs information using colored text (via \pkg{crayon}), making
it easier to visually parse the summary. It organizes output into sections:
\itemize{
\item Selected variables and their counts
\item Variables selected by each outcome
\item Selected lambda tuning parameters
\item Summary of penalty factors
\item Number of stored models
\item Goodness-of-fit metrics for each outcome, including cross-validation
error statistics and metrics on full data fit
\item Coefficients at the lambda minimizing error, ordered by magnitude
\item Interaction terms and main effects metadata
}
If the \pkg{crayon} package is not installed, the function will stop with an error.

# Assuming 'lasso_cv_obj' is a select_auxiliary_variables_lasso_cv object:
