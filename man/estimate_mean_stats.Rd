\title{Estimate Survey-Weighted Means (Overall or By Domain)}
\usage{
estimate_mean_stats(design, vars, by = NULL, population_means = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{A survey design object (e.g., from the \strong{survey} package).
The object must contain survey data and weights.}

\item{vars}{A character vector of variable names to compute means for. These variables must
exist in \code{design$variables}.}

\item{by}{Optional. A one-sided formula (e.g., \code{~region}) or a character vector of domain
variables for stratified analysis. If \code{NULL}, computes overall means across all data.}

\item{population_means}{Optional. A named numeric vector with population means (for \code{by = NULL})
or a data frame containing domain variables and population means (for \code{by} not \code{NULL}). Used
to calculate bias and MSE for each variable.}
}
\value{
A named list where each component is a data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{domain columns}{Columns for the domain variables (if \code{by} is specified).}
\item{variable}{The name of the variable.}
\item{mean}{The survey-weighted mean of the variable.}
\item{se}{The standard error of the survey-weighted mean.}
\item{bias}{The difference between the survey-weighted mean and the population mean. \code{NA} if
\code{population_means} is not provided.}
\item{mse}{The mean squared error (MSE) of the survey-weighted mean. \code{NA} if \code{population_means}
is not provided.}
}
}
\description{
Computes survey-weighted means and standard errors for one or more variables in a
survey design, optionally stratified by domains (e.g., regions, groups). If population
means are provided, it also calculates the bias and mean squared error (MSE) of the estimates
compared to the population means.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Observations with non-finite \strong{weights} are excluded from the analysis globally.
\item For each variable, observations with non-finite values are also dropped (in addition to the
global weight filter). An error will occur if no valid data remains.
\item For domain-specific means, \code{population_means} must include all domain columns and the variable
being estimated. The rows are merged by domain key.
